# Career-Fair-Matching-Command-line-basd-tool

> Because career fairs allow little time to talk to more than a few companies, we wanted to create a program that would give students a targeted list of companies that they could research and prepare for before the career fair. This way, time wouldn’t be spent trying to figure out if a certain company was one that that particular student would be interested in or not. The goal of this project is to provide students with a list of companies whose jobs they meet the criteria for, and whose industries they are interested in. Our program is also meant to expose students to companies that they may not have heard of before, and show employers possible candidates for their jobs. Students are then provided with a short list of potential employers that are ranked based off the student’s interests, and they have that tool to help them prepare for the career fair and hopefully land a job.
